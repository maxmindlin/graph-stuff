A playground repo for me to explore graph implementations and algorithms. Nothing here is considered done.

## TODO

- [ ] many of the algorithms are implemented across a generic *adjacency-matrix* graph. For many algorithms this is actually sub-optimal. Implement a adjacency-list graph and then have the algorithms being generic over either.
